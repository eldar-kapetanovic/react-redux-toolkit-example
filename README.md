## About project

`Google Firebase` database is used as a backend for this small showcase app. 

Read access is granted for all, so anyone can read posts and comments. Only authenticated users can edit data. For login application uses 
"Email and password-based authentication" from Firebase SDK. 

The test account for this application is:
username: `uset@posts.com`
password: `Test1234`

The intention of this application is to show how the Redux can be used to manage the state in the React application.
